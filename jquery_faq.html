    // Under the FAQ, add 3 unordered lists like above. Each list should contain a national park name in an h3 element, and a ul of 4 facts about the park.

    // Create a button that, when clicked, makes the last li in each ul have a yellow background.

    // $("li:last-child").css("background-color", "yellow");

    // Create 3 divs that each look like a picture frame. Each one should have a unique background image and a button underneath that swaps the image from the frame. Use the traversing functions of jQuery to accomplish this.
    //
    //     The rules are the following:
    //
    //     The left frame swaps to the right and takes the image from the frame in the center.
    //     The center frame swaps randomly to either the left or right.
    //     The right frame swaps to the left and takes the image from the frame in the center.
